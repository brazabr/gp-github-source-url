Modifies GlotPress to make source urls compatible with Github

== Description ==

GlotPress is shipped with support to link source files to Trac urls (based on SVN).
This plugin implements support GitHub link to source files.

If the Source File template url is from GitHub, it will remove the SVN prefix that contains the repo slug and the branch. This will create valid links to source files to your GitHub repository.

== Installation ==

= Manual Installation =

1. Upload the entire `/gp-github-source-url` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate GP Github Source Url through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Who needs this plugin? =

If you have your own installation running GlotPress and one of your source files repository is hosted in GitHub, this plugin is for you.

= What does this plugin do? =

It changes the link to translation string in the source files in a way that, if the source files are hosted in GitHub, the url of the source file is modified and becomes a valid GitHub url.

= What do I need to do after installing the plugin? =

This plugin doesn't have extra settings to be modified via `wp-admin`. All you need to do is to define the url template in your GlotPress project and/or subproject to something like: `https://github.com/user/repo/%file%#L%line%`.

= Does it work with a repository that contains multiple branches? =

Yes. It will add the branch to the url automatically.

WooCommerce is a powerful, extendable eCommerce plugin that helps you sell anything. Beautifully.

== Description ==

WooCommerce is a free eCommerce plugin that allows you to sell anything, beautifully. Built to integrate seamlessly with WordPress, WooCommerce is the world’s favorite eCommerce solution that gives both store owners and developers complete control.

With endless flexibility and access to hundreds of free and premium WordPress extensions, WooCommerce now powers 30% of all online stores -- more than any other platform.

= Sell anything, anywhere =
With WooCommerce, you can sell both physical and digital goods in all shapes and sizes, offer product variations, multiple configurations, and instant downloads to shoppers, and even sell affiliate goods from online marketplaces.

With premium extensions, you can offer bookings, memberships, and recurring subscriptions. Perhaps you’d like to sell monthly subscriptions for physical goods, or offer your members a discount on digital downloads? It’s all possible.

= Ship wherever you like =
Offer free shipping, flat rate shipping, or make real-time calculations. Limit your shipments to specific countries, or open your store up to the world. Shipping is highly configurable, and WooCommerce even supports drop shipping.

= Extensive payment options =
WooCommerce comes bundled with the ability to accept major credit cards, PayPal, BACS (bank transfers), and cash on delivery. Need additional options? More than 140 region-specific gateways integrate with WooCommerce, including popular choices like Stripe, Authorize.Net, and Amazon Payments.

= You control it all -- forever =
WooCommerce gives you complete control of your store, from taxes to stock levels to customer accounts. Add and remove extensions, change your design, and switch settings as you please. It’s all under your control.

One of the biggest risks of using a hosted eCommerce platform is what happens to your store if the provider closes up shop. With WooCommerce, you have complete control, so there’s never any reason to worry. Your data belongs to you -- and it’s kept secure, thanks to regular audits by industry leaders.

= Define your style with Storefront =

[Storefront](https://wordpress.org/themes/storefront/) is a free WordPress theme available to any WooCommerce store. Along with deep WooCommerce integration, Storefront prioritizes speed and uptime while eliminating theme and plugin conflicts during major updates.

Define your style even further by customizing Storefront to your liking or choosing from one of our several [Storefront child themes](https://woocommerce.com/product-category/themes/storefront-child-theme-themes/). It’s all up to you, and all open source.

= Built with developers in mind =

Extendable, adaptable, and open source -- WooCommerce was created with developers in mind. With its strong, robust framework, you can scale your client’s store all the way from basic to high-end (infinity and beyond).

Built with a REST API, WooCommerce can integrate with virtually any service. Your store’s data can be accessed anywhere, anytime, 100% securely. WooCommerce allows developers to easily create, modify, and grow a store that meets their specifications.

No matter the size of the store you want to build, WooCommerce will scale to meet your requirements. With a growing collection of more than 300 extensions, you can enhance each store’s features to meet your client’s unique needs -- or even create your own solution.

If security is a concern, rest easy. WooCommerce is audited by a dedicated team of developers working around the clock to identify and patch any and all discovered bugs.

We also support WooCommerce and all its extensions with comprehensive, easily-accessible documentation. With our docs, you’ll learn how to create the exact site your client needs.

And there’s plenty more where they came from. Visit our [extensions page](https://woocommerce.com/product-category/woocommerce-extensions/) to find out everything you’re capable of and all that's possible with premium WooCommerce extensions.

= Join our growing community =

When you download WooCommerce, you join a community of more than a million store owners, developers, and WordPress enthusiasts. We’re one of the fastest-growing open source communities online, and whether you’re a n00b or a Ninja, we’d love to have you!

If you’re interested in contributing to WooCommerce we’ve got more than 350 contributors, and there’s always room for more. Head over to the [WooCommerce GitHub Repository](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce) to find out how you can pitch in.

Want to add a new language to WooCommerce? Swell! You can contribute via [translate.wordpress.org](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/woocommerce).

And, finally, consider joining or spearheading a WooCommerce Meetup locally, more about those [here](https://woocommerce.com/woocommerce/meetups/).

== Installation ==

= Minimum Requirements =

* PHP version 5.2.4 or greater (PHP 5.6 or greater is recommended)
* MySQL version 5.0 or greater (MySQL 5.6 or greater is recommended)
* Some payment gateways require fsockopen support (for IPN access)
* WooCommerce 2.5 requires WordPress 4.1+
* WooCommerce 2.6 requires WordPress 4.4+

Visit the [WooCommerce server requirements documentation](https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/server-requirements/) for a detailed list of server requirements.

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of WooCommerce, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type “WooCommerce” and click Search Plugins. Once you’ve found our eCommerce plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking “Install Now”.

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading our eCommerce plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favourite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

= Updating =

Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.

If on the off-chance you do encounter issues with the shop/category pages after an update you simply need to flush the permalinks by going to WordPress > Settings > Permalinks and hitting 'save'. That should return things to normal.

= Dummy data =

WooCommerce comes with some dummy data you can use to see how products look; either import dummy_data.xml via the [WordPress importer](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-importer/) or use our [CSV Import Suite plugin](https://woocommerce.com/products/product-csv-import-suite/) to import dummy_data.csv and dummy_data_variations.csv.
